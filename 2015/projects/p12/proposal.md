### 任务  

从在线教育系统的数据中分析学生的学习状况，并预测学生的结课成绩。我们组准备参考着2010年KDD的评测任务做。

### 参考

KDD2010的project idea如下

> How generally or narrowly do students learn? How quickly or slowly? Will the rate of improvement vary between students? What does it mean for one problem to be similar to another? It might depend on whether the knowledge required for one problem is the same as the knowledge required for another. But is it possible to infer the knowledge requirements of problems directly from student performance data, without human analysis of the tasks? We would like to ask you to predict whether a student is likely to be correct or not on each step given based on previous log data. The problem can be formalized as a classification problem. You could also build a model of students' learning behavior and predict the probability of making an error. The challenge here is to select the correct classifier/model that best represents the data. Moreover, maybe not all given features are informative. Models that are over-complicated may overfit. How to find the relevant features and make good use of them are interesting topics.
